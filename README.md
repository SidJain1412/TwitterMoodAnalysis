# TwitterMoodAnalysis
A python script that analyses the tweets of 40 of the people that you are following and gives your timeline a score based on the sentiments of their tweets.
Replace consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token and access_secret with your twitter app credentials.Â 
Change screen_name on line 35 to the username desired.
Change "15" on line 42 to a higher number of tweets for more accuracy.
Please allow the program to run for a while as it implements cleaning and sentiment analysis on hundreds of tweets.
